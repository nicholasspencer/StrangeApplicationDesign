## Strange Application Design
A sample application written in Objective-C that shows 
some best practices and modern design patterns inspired 
by some sample code and documentation from Apple. 
It sort of resembles MVC, I guess, if dictionaries count
as models. It's also missing views but don't worry you can do that
sort of stuff in `UIViewController`s.

(this is programmer satire)
